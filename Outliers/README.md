Outlier Detection and Treatment
This folder contains code for identifying and handling outliers in your data using three primary statistical methods:

-> Z-Score :- For Normal Distribution curve.

-> IQR (Interquartile Range) :- For Skewed Curve

-> Winsorization

Treatment Options
Each method includes two ways to handle the detected outliers:

Trimming: Removes the outliers from the dataset entirely.

Capping: Replaces outliers with the nearest "safe" boundary values.
